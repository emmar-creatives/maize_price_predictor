Project: Maize Price Prediction Model

A Streamlit web app that uses an LSTM neural network to predict maize prices per husk in Ondo, Nigeria.


Files included:
- lstm_model.h5 ............... Trained LSTM model in legacy HDF5 format
- lstm_model.keras ............ Trained LSTM model in new native Keras format
- ondo_maize_price_per_husk.csv Data file used for training

Instructions:
- Use Keras to load either lstm_model.h5 or lstm_model.keras
- Data file is in CSV format containing historical maize prices
